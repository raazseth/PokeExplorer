# React Native Pok√©mon App

This is a **React Native** application that allows users to interact with Pok√©mon data in a fun and engaging way. The app features Pok√©mon profiles, quizzes, wishlist functionality, and notifications. It uses **React Query** for data fetching and caching, integrates Firebase for authentication, and handles local and push notifications.

    This API enriches the user experience by providing deep and fun Pok√©mon knowledge directly in the app.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Local Notifications & Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
- Local notifications are handled using **Notifee** for instant alerts about Pok√©mon, quiz reminders, and more. 
- Push notifications are integrated with **FCM** to notify users about app updates and important events.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Tab State Management**
- The app manages state persistence for the bottom navigation tabs (Home, Wishlist, Search).
- Users return to their last visited tab when reopening the app, ensuring a seamless experience.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **React Query & Caching**
- Uses **React Query** for fetching Pok√©mon data from APIs and caches the results for **5 minutes** to optimize performance.
- The data is automatically refreshed after 5 minutes to keep it up to date.

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Quiz Bottom Sheet** & **Profile Bottom Sheet**
- **Quiz Bottom Sheet**: When users participate in quizzes, the app uses **React Native Bottom Sheet** to display a sleek, interactive quiz interface that slides up from the bottom of the screen. This bottom sheet allows users to take the quiz without leaving the current page.
  
- **Profile Bottom Sheet**: The user profile is managed via a **bottom sheet** that slides up when the profile button is pressed. This includes a detailed view of the user's account information, making it accessible from anywhere in the app.

Both bottom sheets are powered by the popular **[React Native Bottom Sheet](https://gorhom.dev/react-native-bottom-sheet/)** library, providing smooth animations and an intuitive user interface.

# Assumptions:

1. **User Familiarity with Pok√©mon**: Let's assume that users have some basic familiarity with the Pok√©mon universe. This means that the app may include references to Pok√©mon species, moves, and lore, and users are expected to understand these terms without a lot of explanation. We‚Äôre not aiming for beginners here, but rather Pok√©mon fans who already know the basics.

2. **Stable Internet Connection**: Since the app pulls data from external APIs (like **PokeAPI** and **Gemini API**), we‚Äôre assuming that users have a stable internet connection. While offline mode is not the focus of this app, some features (like Pok√©mon profile details, quizzes, and notifications) rely on being online to fetch or update data.

3. **User Permissions**: The app assumes that users are willing to grant permissions for things like **push notifications**. Without these permissions, some app features (like notifications) may not function as expected.

4. **Device Compatibility**: We‚Äôve designed the app to work on a wide range of Android and iOS devices. However, we‚Äôre assuming that the users are using relatively recent versions of Android or iOS. Some older devices or OS versions might not support certain features like push notifications or smooth animations.

5. **Quiz Interaction**: We assume that users will be interacting with the **Pok√©mon quizzes** and **story sections** with a certain level of engagement. The quiz is designed for Pok√©mon fans, so the difficulty levels and the content will cater to users who enjoy a challenge or a fun interactive experience.

6. **Local Notification and Cache Management**: The app assumes that users enable **local notifications** and rely on **React Query's caching** mechanism to enhance performance. We‚Äôve put in caching limits (like 5 minutes), so users can expect a more optimized experience without hitting API rate limits often.

7. **App's Focus on Entertainment**: The primary focus of the app is entertainment, specifically around Pok√©mon trivia, quizzes, and interactive stories. We‚Äôre assuming users are here for fun, not for serious gameplay or other non-entertainment-focused features.

# Limitations:

1. **Gemini API Content**: The content you see in the app is strictly based on **anime** and official **Pok√©mon lore**. We‚Äôre sticking to canon material here, so don‚Äôt expect any fan-made Pok√©mon or unofficial content in the mix.

2. **Push Notifications Permissions**: I use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications, but for this to work, users need to give explicit permission to receive them. If a user declines, they won‚Äôt get notifications, which might mean missing out on certain app updates or features.

3. **Platform-Specific Issues**: I‚Äôve made sure the app works well on both **Android** and **iOS**, but certain libraries (like the **React Native Bottom Sheet**) might behave slightly differently depending on the platform or device version. So, while we‚Äôre doing our best for consistency, some platform-specific quirks might pop up from time to time.

4. **API Rate Limits**: I'm pulling data from the **PokeAPI** and **Gemini API**, but these APIs have rate limits on how many requests we can make within a certain period. To help with this, I‚Äôve set up **React Query** to manage caching and reduce unnecessary calls, but if too many requests are made too quickly, we might run into some delays fetching fresh data.

5. **Device Compatibility**: It supports both **Android** and **iOS**, but some device models or OS versions might have quirks, especially with things like push notifications or authentication. If you‚Äôre on an older device or OS version, expect some potential extra debugging or configuration to get things running smoothly.
